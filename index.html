          My mother was born on 16th December 1972.  
          She has always been the strongest and most selfless person I know—  
          a hardworking woman who puts others before herself and makes sure her family is cared for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I was a child, she has given me and my sister nothing but the best,  
          guiding us with love and strength every step of the way. She is, and will always be, my hero.
